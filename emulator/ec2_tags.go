// ec2ReservedTagPrefix is the tag-key prefix EC2 reserves for its own use. A caller
// cannot create, edit, or delete a tag whose key begins with it.
//
// The match is case-sensitive, and deliberately so: the EC2 tagging documentation
// states that "tag keys and values are case-sensitive", and every observed rejection
// quotes the lowercase form. A case-folded check would reject "AWS:foo", which real
// EC2 accepts as an ordinary user tag — trading one infidelity for another.
//
// Source note: the CreateTags reference's Errors section is empty, so neither the
// error code nor its message is derivable from the API model. Both come from observed
// real-AWS responses — two independent captures giving byte-identical text, one of
// which records "Service: AmazonEC2; Status Code: 400; Error Code:
// InvalidParameterValue". Both captures are of RunInstances tag-on-create rather than
// CreateTags; the message is evidently shared across the tagging paths, but substrate
// has not observed it on CreateTags directly.

// ec2ReservedTagKeyError returns the error EC2 raises for a reserved tag key.

// The tags are checked in slice order — extractEC2Tags preserves the request's Tag.N
// numbering — so the request that is rejected is decided identically on every run. A
// map would make it iteration-order dependent, which is the opposite of what this
// emulator is for.
//
// Callers must check before applying anything. CreateTags accepts up to 1000 resource
// IDs, and rejecting partway through the loop would leave the earlier resources tagged
// and the rest not, a state real EC2 never produces.
